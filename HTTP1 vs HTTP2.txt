Difference between HTTP1 and HTTP2:
      1.HTTP1 was founded in 1997
      1.HTTP2 was founded in 2015
      2. HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
      2. HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
      3.HTTP1 introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about the status of messages.can define 24 status code,error reporting is quicker and more efficient.
      3.Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers,status codes remains the same.
      4.HTTP1 is slower.
      4.HTTP2 is much faster.
      5.HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.
      5.HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
      6.HTTP/1.1 provides faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP/1.0. However, TCP starts slowly and with domain sharding (resources can be downloaded simultaneously by using multiple domains), connection reuse and pipelining, there is an increased risk of network congestion.
      6.HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater margin along with being less sensitive to network delays.
